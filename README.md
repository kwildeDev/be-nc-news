To run this project locally you will need to create environment variables after cloning. Create two files as follows at the top level of the local repo:

- `.env.test`
- `.env.development`

In each file enter the line `PGDATABASE=database_name_here`, replacing `database_name_here` with the **test database** for `.env.test`, and with the **development database** for `.env.development`.

The database names can be found in the file `setup.sql` within the repo.
